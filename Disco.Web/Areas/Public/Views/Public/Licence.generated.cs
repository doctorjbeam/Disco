"able work licensed under this License.\r\n    Each licensee is addressed as &quot;" +
"you&quot;. &quot;Licensees&quot; and &quot;recipients&quot;\r\n    may be individu" +
"als or organizations.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy f" +

"ssion, other than the making of an exact copy.\r\n    The resulting work is called" +
" a &quot;modified version&quot; of the earlier work\r\n    or a work &quot;based o" +
"n&quot; the earlier work.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    A &quot;covered work&quot; means either " +

"ot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without permission," +
"\r\n    would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under appli" +
"cable\r\n    copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a priva" +
"te copy. Propagation\r\n    includes copying, distribution (with or without modifi" +
"cation), making available\r\n    to the public, and in some countries other activi" +
"ties as well.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propa" +
"gation that enables other parties\r\n    to make or receive copies. Mere interacti" +
"on with a user through a computer network,\r\n    with no transfer of a copy, is n" +

WriteLiteral("></a>1. Source Code.</h4>\r\n<p>\r\n    The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means " +
"the preferred form of the work for\r\n    making modifications to it. &quot;Object" +
" code&quot; means any non-source form of\r\n    a work.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    A &quot;Stan" +
"dard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official standard\r\n   " +
" defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified" +
"\r\n    for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among devel" +
"opers\r\n    working in that language.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The &quot;System Libraries&qu" +
"ot; of an executable work include anything, other than\r\n    the work as a whole," +
" that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major\r\n    Component, bu" +
"t which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to\r\n    enable " +
"use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface\r" +
"\n    for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form." +
" A &quot;Major\r\n    Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential co" +
"mponent (kernel, window\r\n    system, and so on) of the specific operating system" +
" (if any) on which the executable\r\n    work runs, or a compiler used to produce " +
"the work, or an object code interpreter\r\n    used to run it.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The &" +
"quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all the\r\n  " +
"  source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the " +
"object\r\n    code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those acti" +
"vities. However,\r\n    it does not include the work\'s System Libraries, or genera" +
"l-purpose tools or generally\r\n    available free programs which are used unmodif" +
"ied in performing those activities\r\n    but which are not part of the work. For " +
"example, Corresponding Source includes interface\r\n    definition files associate" +
"d with source files for the work, and the source code\r\n    for shared libraries " +
"and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically\r\n    designed t" +
"o require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between\r\n    t" +
"hose subprograms and other parts of the work.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The Corresponding So" +
"urce need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically\r\n    from" +
" other parts of the Corresponding Source.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The Corresponding Source" +

WriteLiteral(@"></a>2. Basic Permissions.</h4>
<p>
    All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the
    Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License
    explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The
    output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output,
    given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights
    of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.</p>
<p>
    You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions
    so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works
    to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for
    you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply
    with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control
    copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively
    on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from
    making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.</p>
<p>
    Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions
    stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.</p>

WriteLiteral(@"></a>3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention
    Law.</h4>
<p>
    No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under
    any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright
    treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention
    of such measures.</p>
<p>
    When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention
    of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising
    rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any
    intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing,
    against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention
    of technological measures.</p>

WriteLiteral(@"></a>4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.</h4>
<p>
    You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in
    any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy
    an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License
    and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep
    intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy
    of this License along with the Program.</p>

    You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may
    offer support or warranty protection for a fee.</p>

"in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that\r\n    you " +

"minent notices stating that you modified it, and giving\r\n        a relevant date" +
".</li>\r\n    <li>b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is rele" +
"ased under this\r\n        License and any conditions added under section 7. This " +
"requirement modifies the\r\n        requirement in section 4 to &quot;keep intact " +
"all notices&quot;.</li>\r\n    <li>c) You must license the entire work, as a whole" +
", under this License to anyone who\r\n        comes into possession of a copy. Thi" +
"s License will therefore apply, along with any\r\n        applicable section 7 add" +
"itional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\r\n        regardless " +
"of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license\r\n        t" +
"he work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have" +
"\r\n        separately received it.</li>\r\n    <li>d) If the work has interactive u" +
"ser interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal\r\n        Notices; however, i" +
"f the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display\r\n        Appropriat" +
"e Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n    A com" +
"pilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which\r\n   " +

"ned\r\n    with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storag" +

"tion and its resulting\r\n    copyright are not used to limit the access or legal " +
"rights of the compilation\'s\r\n    users beyond what the individual works permit. " +
"Inclusion of a covered work in an\r\n    aggregate does not cause this License to " +
"apply to the other parts of the aggregate.</p>\r\n<h4>\r\n    <a");

WriteLiteral(@"></a>8. Termination.</h4>
<p>
    You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under
    this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will
    automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses
    granted under the third paragraph of section 11).</p>
<p>
    However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular
    copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright
    holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
    copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior
    to 60 days after the cessation.</p>
<p>
    Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently
    if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means,
    this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for
    any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
    after your receipt of the notice.</p>
<p>
    Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of
    parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your
    rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to
    receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.</p>

<p>
    You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of
    the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence
    of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.
    However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify
    any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.
    Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance
    of this License to do so.</p>

<p>
    If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise)
    that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
    conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy
    simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations,
    then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to
    terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to
    whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and
    this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.</p>

<p>
    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the Program,

    through a computer network (if your version supports such interaction) an opportunity
    to receive the Corresponding Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding
    Source from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary means

    in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems

<p>
    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies
    that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General Public License &quot;or

    If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU
    Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance
    of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.</p>
